**Ubuntu** is the most well-known Linux operating system variant. It became popular by its universal usability, as it doesn't require technical knowledge to use it. 

You can try out Ubuntu before installing it. Furthermore, aside from replacing your current operating system, you can install it next to it (called a "dual boot" system). Furthermore, a lot of other Linux distributions are based on Ubuntu.
