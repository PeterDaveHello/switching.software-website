**Jitsi Meet** is a free open source video chat app made by volunteers. You can use it through their website or through the mobile apps.

It is extremely easy to use: you donâ€™t need to register, all you need to do is make up the name of a chat room and send the link to whoever you want to join you. You can also add a room password if you want.
