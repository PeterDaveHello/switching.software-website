**GoatCounter** is a web analytics platform – roughly similar to Google Analytics or Matomo – but easier to use. It aims to give meaningful privacy-friendly web analytics for business purposes, while still staying usable for non-technical users to use on personal websites.

It can be self-hosted or you can use a SaaS offering, which is free for non-commercial use up to 100k pageviews/month.
