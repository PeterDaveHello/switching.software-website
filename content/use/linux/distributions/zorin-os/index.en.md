**Zorin OS** is a beautiful Ubuntu-based operating system. It's focussed on making the transition from Windows or macOS to Linux as easy as possible.

As with Ubuntu, you can try it before installing, replace your current operating system or install it next to it ("dual boot"). If you want to support the development, you can buy an extended version.
