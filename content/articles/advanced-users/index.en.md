Switching.software is for non-technical people, and it’s always going to stay that way.

However, if you use technology a lot and know a fair bit about computers, you might want to check out these sites. They too provide ethical privacy-friendly alternatives, but they assume a lot more prior knowledge:

[De-google-ify Internet][de-google] – A very comprehensive list of privacy-friendly apps and internet services by the French open source enthusiasts Framasoft, including a lot of stuff for website owners, business people, developers and others.

[Prism Break][prism] – A slightly cloak-and-dagger guide for advanced users on how to avoid mass surveillance programmes.

[LineageOS][lineage] – An alternative open source operating system for Android smartphones which removes Google’s apps and services. List of [LineageOS compatible phones][lineage-devices] here.

[instances.social][instances] – Guide to Mastodon instances, to help advanced users choose a suitable instance.

[Fediverse.party][fediverse] – A trippy, fantasy-themed guide to all the federated social networks currently available or in development, with technical details on each network.

[The Federation][federation] – Public statistics about all federated social networks (note that the stats are only from opted-in sites, so some sites aren’t listed).

[Compute Freely][compute-freely] – A guide to switching to Linux on your computer.

[Linux Games][linux-games] – List of open source games for Linux and other platforms.
