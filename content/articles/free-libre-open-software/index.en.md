Most pages and tools on switching.software are labeled as **Free/Libre** or **Open Source** software.
But what does this mean?
And what's the benefit of it?

### Prorietary = Restrictions

Much of the software in use today is restricted in one way or another.
You can't look at their inner workings, let alone create your own version of it.

Suppose you want to offer cake to your friends.
Of course you can easily buy an off-the-shelf cake at the bakery.
However, with this **proprietary cake** it's unclear what exactly it contains.
You can hardly adapt it to your wishes and tomorrow, it might no longer be sold.

Be it software or cake, you are completely dependent on the providers.
You hardly have a lot of knowledge or influence on the ingredients.

### FLOSS = Freedom and Openness

To overcome these restrictions, you basically need the recipe.
For software, this corresponds to having access to the source code.

Furthermore, you need the permission to use it in your own way.
Which is an appropriate license for software.

**F**ree/**L**ibre and **O**pen-**S**ource-**S**oftware (FLOSS) offers both of these.
So, software (and cake) based on this can be truly yours.

This enables more trust in software and more flexibility in its use.
Anyone can check its components, report errors (or fix them oneself),
create their own variations and share them with others.
All of this gives you more choice and more security - even as a pure "consumer".

### What is Free/Libre Software?

Frei/Libre means, simply put, that everyone can **use, study, distribute and adapt** a piece of software as they please. 
These four freedoms are the foundation of Free Software.

    <div class="column col-4 col-ml-auto"><div class="toast toast-success">USE</div></div>
    <div class="column col-4 col-mr-auto"><div class="toast toast-success">STUDY</div></div>
</div>
<div class="columns text-center pt-2">
    <div class="column col-4 col-ml-auto"><div class="toast toast-success">SHARE</div></div>
    <div class="column col-4 col-mr-auto"><div class="toast toast-success">IMPROVE</div></div>
</div></p>

In this context, Free isn't related to the price ("free of charge"), but to freedom.
To avoid this ambiguity, the term Libre Software is often used.

The majority won't ever make full use of these four freedoms.
But we all benefit from the possibilities they offer.
They allow interested users to fix bugs, make improvements and share their changes with the world.
Free Software goes hand in hand with **Open Source** - the full disclosure of the source code.
