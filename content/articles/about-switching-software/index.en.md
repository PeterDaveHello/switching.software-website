### What is this?

Switching.software is a grassroots website, that is trying to let people know about ethical and easy-to-use alternatives to well-known websites, apps and other software. 

### Where can I follow this site?

You can follow switching.software on the Fediverse via [our Mastodon account][swiso-mastodon]. Other channels may follow in the future.

### Where does this site come from?

Switching.software is a fork of a former website known as ['switching.social'][switching.social]. It was created and maintained by an anonymous person and gained popularity in 2018 and 2019 - especially on the [Fediverse][fediverse].

In September 2019, the author took down all social media channels and the website itself. There hasn't been any statement by them ever since. No matter the reasons, [we want to thank them a lot][thanks] for what they have archieved with this project - and wish them well.

To keep the project alive, the site was restored from different sources - resulting in [a bunch of HTML pages][swiso-archive]. Since then, a loose team of enthusiasts has started a fork based on the original articles. We want to maintain and improve the project. Progress on this endeavor can be seen in [our repository][swiso-repo].

### Why was this site founded?

As we haven't founded this site ourselves, we want to quote from the [original answer from 'switching.social'][swisoc-about] here:

> **If a complete stranger knocked on your door** and asked for a copy of all your emails in exchange for $1, would you accept such a deal? Probably not, but if you use Gmail that’s the deal you’re accepting: Google gets to read all your emails, and in exchange Google gives you a mailbox that costs about $1 a month to run. [...]

> **Many companies are now hopelessly addicted to gathering data.** Their share price depends on not just gathering data but doing so at an ever-greater pace, even driving them to break the law. [...]

> **What can an individual do to stop all this?** How can one person make a difference? By using apps and services that do not steal data, and encouraging others to do the same. That’s what switching.social is for: To make it as easy as possible for people to find ethical alternatives that respect privacy.
