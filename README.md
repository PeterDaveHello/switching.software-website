[Switching.software](https://switching.software) is based on the work of [switching.social](https://web.archive.org/web/20190915101437/https://switching.social/). There has been a lot of adaptions since its shutdown in September 2019. We added graphics, rearranged entries, updated texts and much more. Nevertheless, it still guides us on our way.
