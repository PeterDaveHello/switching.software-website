## About

**switching.software** is a collection of ethical, easy-to-use and privacy-conscious alternatives to well-known software.

This site is only possible thanks to a few free and open projects:

- [switching.social](https://web.archive.org/web/20190915101437/https://switching.social/): The original site, that went offline in September 2019, but was restored [here](https://codeberg.org/swiso-en/archive)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/): A powerful open-source static site generator 
- [Codeberg.org](https://codeberg.org/): A non-profit and non-government organization, that gives our codebase a home - powered by [Gitea](http://gitea.com/).

## License

[Switching.software](https://switching.software) is based on the work of [switching.social](https://web.archive.org/web/20190915101437/https://switching.social/). There has been a lot of adaptions since its shutdown in September 2019, but it still guides us.

## Contribute

Currently, this project is in a very early stage of redesigning and reorganizing the codebase. So, there is no fixed process or similar stuff.

First Todo would be, to migrate every entry of every list on [switching.software](https://switching.software) - see [ticket #1](https://codeberg.org/swiso-en/website/issues/1).
