**Decentraleyes** is an add-on which emulates a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to improve your privacy.

It works by intercepting network requests to CDNs, checking if the requested file is stored locally, serving the locally stored file if it's available.

! **Downloads:** [Firefox][1] | [Google Chrome][2] | [Opera][3]
