Instead of asking humans to verify themselves, you can try tricking bots into revealing themselves by interacting with “honeypots”.

Honeypots are web page elements that are invisible to real humans, but visible to bots. If interaction is recorded with them, this may be enough to detect and counteract bots.

There are many websites with more details about this method.
