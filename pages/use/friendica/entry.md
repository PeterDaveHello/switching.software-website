**Friendica** is a Facebook-style social network with similar features including events and photo albums. Like Mastodon, Friendica is made up of many smaller sites linked together through [federation](https://web.archive.org/web/20190508232759/https://switching.social/federated-sites/). The smaller sites that make up the Friendica network are called “nodes”.

Friendica is also connected to [Mastodon](/use/mastodon), [Diaspora](/use/diaspora), [PixelFed](/use/pixelfed), [PeerTube](/use/peertube) and many other alternative social networks, so you can make friends with people on all those networks too.
