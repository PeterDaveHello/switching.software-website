**PeerTube** is an open source federated alternative to YouTube. It’s a video-oriented social network that doesn’t have ads and doesn’t track you. It’s still very new so there isn’t much content to view, but it’s growing very fast.

Unlike YouTube, PeerTube is made up of lots of independent sites that talk to each other. It doesn’t matter which site you sign up at, they’re all part of the same network. You can also embed PeerTube videos elsewhere, as seen in the example above.

Even better, because PeerTube uses the ActivityPub standard its channels can be followed by millions of people on [Mastodon][1] and other ActivityPub-powered social networks.
