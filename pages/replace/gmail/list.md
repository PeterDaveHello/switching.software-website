Email is something almost everyone uses nowadays, and we usually assume that no one else can read our messages. However, if you use a service with advertisements such as Gmail, Yahoo Mail or Outlook, your messages are not private and [can be read by other people and companies][1].

A much better option is to use an email service without advertising. They can be free up to a certain storage limit, and cost as little as $1 / €1 a month to get more storage. Because they have no advertisers and instead depend on monthly fees for their income, they have much better incentives to keep their customers’ mails private.
