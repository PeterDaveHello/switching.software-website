If you use an Android phone, you probably install apps through the Google Play Store.

Google Play is very useful for finding apps, but not so great for privacy. Google itself tracks what people install, and Google Play is full of dubious software which is opaque and doesnâ€™t respect privacy.

A better alternative is F-Droid.
